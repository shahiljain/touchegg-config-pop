# touchegg-config-pop
A touchegg configuration for windows like gesture navigation on Pop!_OS 21.04
# Overview:
1. Swipe Up Three Fingers: Workspaces
2. Swipe Down Three Fingers: Show Desktop
3. Swipe Right Three Fingers: Switch Apps (Alt+Tab)
4. Swipe Up/Down Four Fingers: Move Up/Down Workspaces
5. Swipe Left/Right Four Fingers: Show All Apps
# Installation
1. Install X11 Gestures Gnome extension (Necessary to enable 4 Finger swipe up/down gestures)
1. Dowload the touchegg.conf file
2. Paste it to ~/.config/touchegg
# Notes
1. There are drop down options for stuff like show desktop and switch workspaces but they seemed laggy and the animations were old, atleast to me personally.
2. Also something to learn is that here if you want the opposite of your action you will have to use the same gesture. For Example, if you use three finger swipe down to show desktop you have to do the same to show windows (Because three finger swipe up is for workspaces).
